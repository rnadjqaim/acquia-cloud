The exact configuration of a Cloud Platform application’s infrastructure depends on several factors, including anticipated monthly traffic levels, whether the application is part of Cloud Platform Enterprise (including Site Factory) or Cloud Platform Professional, and whether or not the application’s environments are running on the Cloud Classic version of Cloud Platform or the more advanced Cloud Next version
As indicated in the previous diagrams, Cloud Platform Enterprise and Cloud Platform Professional applications each have the following main components:

Cloud Platform CDN (optional) for global cached content delivery (Fastly)
Regional reverse proxy caching and load balancing infrastructure (Nginx and Varnish®) with TLS (SSL) termination
Application layer infrastructure (Apache, PHP, Drupal code, cron, SSH and Memcached)
File system infrastructure
Cloud Classic: Redhat Gluster
Cloud Next: AWS EFS
Database infrastructure
Cloud Classic: Percona MySQL
Cloud Next: AWS Aurora
