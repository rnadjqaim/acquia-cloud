The following concepts are part of sciario and drupal architecture, i'd consult devops side and drupal develope side in this matter. 

- for front-end content, and its affects of the country and locations, what is best practice solution for caching
1. enable GeIP cache feature, 
2. disable varnish and enable CDN for all variants
3. enable varnish and disable GEOIP 
4. enable Acquia purge. 


- where we save the env vairables in codebase ( it should choose over one answer ) 
1. .htaccess,
2. php script, 
3. ,mysql queries. 


- sync directory during configuration management, what this sync will do 
1. could overwrite the drupal variable like $base_ur. 
2. other answers.

- API with Varnish :
1. clear cache
2. make changes on Varnish ( custom config VCL )
3. API did not control Varnish (I have chosen this ) 

-when I move part of repo/ configs/code to .gitigore. 

- if Drupal application has many of error, what we can do ? reset the  code, remove files and db. ( toll back ) 

- acquia does not support let's encrypt  ( i choose this while asking about SSL ) 
- upload code by ftp .
- installing drupal ( tar, zip ) method
- when you need to check the code before committed, you can enable job by : pipline, cloudhook, team will check
- drush will be pre-installed out of the codebase, it locates in vendor, or include with the codebase in docroot
-any change between Drupal code bases in cloud and in local environment ?
- piplines acquia did not running outside 
if pipline went to access module from other private repo 




Acquia's pipelines do not run externally.

If a pipeline needs to access a module from another private repository...
